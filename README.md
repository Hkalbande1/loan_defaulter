### Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **classification model** to predict whether a customer is likely to default based on financial and demographic information. The analysis involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation** using multiple machine learning algorithms.

The objective is to build a reliable model that accurately identifies potential defaulters, supporting **data-driven decision-making** in financial risk assessment. Model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** to ensure balanced and interpretable results.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and patterns influencing default risk.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Derived meaningful features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Development** – Trained and compared multiple classification algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
5. **Evaluation** – Assessed results using classification metrics and visualizations like confusion matrix and ROC curves.
